ShawnDCstudent,2020-01-25 23:05:34+00:00,Gulp. I keep wondering why they don't just take an existing building and convert it into a hospital. Wouldn't that be easier? There must be vacant building or new construction where no one has moved in yet that would be easier to convert than starting from a vacant lot.
